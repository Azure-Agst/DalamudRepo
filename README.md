In order to use the plugins hosted here, you'll need to add this repo to your list of third party repos. To do so, open your dalamud settings and do the following:

1. Select the "Experimental" tab, scroll down to the Custom Plugin Repository listing and read and accept the warning.
2. Once able, paste the following link into the bottom text box:
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Agst/DalamudRepo/master/repo.json`
3. Press the plus button on the right side of the text box to add the repo
4. Press the save button to let your changes take effect

After this is done, the repo's plugins should show up in your normal plugin listing.
